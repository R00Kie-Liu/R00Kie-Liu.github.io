Huabin Liu (刘华斌) is currently a 5th-year Ph.D student at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), working with [Prof. Weiyao Lin](https://weiyaolin.github.io/) on **video understanding and analysis**. From Jan 2024, I started my visit to the [VISLab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/vislab/) at [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/) as a visiting researcher for 1 year, advised by [Prof. Cees Snoek](https://www.ceessnoek.info/) and [Prof. Filip Ilievski](https://www.ilievski.info/). From 2023 to 2024, I was a research intern at the [Shanghai AI Lab](https://www.shlab.org.cn/), working with [Xiao Sun](https://jimmysuen.github.io/). Before starting pursuing my Ph.D, I was lucky to be a research intern at [Aibee](https://www.aibee.com/), supervised by [Dian Li](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=rF7HU94AAAAJ) and [Jianguo Li](https://sites.google.com/site/leeplus/). Prior to this, I obtained my bachelor’s degree from [Xidian University](https://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2019. 

My research focus on computer vision, especially on **video analysis**. My previous research covers **fine-grained image recognition, few-shot action recognition**. Currently, I mainly focus on **video reasoning, dense video captioning, videoLLMs**.
